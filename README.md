This is a project folder for the accounting data processing of BuzzCloud, the contact person and CEO is Roger Lewis.

Roger who needs a Python project to be developed. It's a double-entry checker for accounting. 

The program will take a bank records file and a expense receipts file (both CSV format). Then it must match the records that appear in both and report back if there are any that only appear on one leger. It also needs to translate some Mandarin to English, and export the file into a program called Xero (but that will come later)# BuzzCloud-Accounting
